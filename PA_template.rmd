## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Mean and median number of steps taken each day
Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report

#1 Load the dataset
```{r, 1 }
A <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

#1 Transform the date attribute to an actual date format
A$date <- as.POSIXct(A$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

#1 Compute the weekdays from the date attribute
A <- data.frame(date=A$date, 
                           weekday=tolower(weekdays(A$date)), 
                           steps=A$steps, 
                           interval=A$interval)

#1 Compute whether weekend or weekday
A <- cbind(A, 
                      daytype=ifelse(A$weekday == "saturday" | 
                                     A$weekday == "sunday", "weekend", 
                                     "weekday"))

#1 Make the final date frame
activity <- data.frame(date=A$date, 
                       weekday=A$weekday, 
                       daytype=A$daytype, 
                       interval=A$interval,
                       steps=A$steps)


```

```{r, activity,results='markup'}
head(activity)
```

#2 Histogram
```{r,2, echo=TRUE}
sum_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
names(sum_data) <- c("date", "total")
hist(sum_data$total, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=5000),
     col="blue", 
     xlab="Total  steps", 
     ylim=c(0, 40), 
     main="Total number of steps taken each day")
```

#3 Mean and median total steps per day

```{r,3}
mean(sum_data$total)
median(sum_data$total)
```

#4 Compute the means of steps accross all days for each interval
```{r,4}
mean_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by=list(activity$interval), 
                       FUN=mean, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)


plot(mean_data$interval, 
     mean_data$mean, 
     type="l", 
     col="green", 
     lwd=2, 
     xlab="minutes", 
     ylab="Average number of steps", 
     main="Time-series of the average number of steps per interval")
```


#5 The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r,5}
max_interval <- which.max(mean_data$mean)
mean_data[max_interval, ]

```


#6 Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
 
```{r,6}
# Find the NA positions
na_pos <- which(is.na(activity$steps))

# Create a vector of means
mean_vec <- rep(mean(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE), times=length(na_pos))
#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
# Replace the NAs by the means
activity[na_pos, "steps"] <- mean_vec

# Compute the total number of steps each day (NA values removed)
sum_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=sum)

# Rename the attributes
names(sum_data) <- c("date", "total")

#Total number of steps with means  subbed in for missing value
hist(sum_data$total, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=5000),
     col="blue", 
     xlab="Total number of steps", 
     ylim=c(0, 40), 
     main="Total number of steps taken each day NA subbed for mean)")
```

#7 Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
```{r,7}
library(ggplot2)
mean(sum_data$total)
median(sum_data$total)


# Compute the average number of steps taken\averaged across all variables
mean_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by=list(activity$daytype, 
                               activity$weekday, activity$interval), mean)
names(mean_data) <- c("daytype", "weekday", "interval", "mean")

ggplot(mean_data,aes(interval,mean))+ 
         geom_line(color="red") + 
        facet_wrap(~ daytype, nrow=2, ncol=1) +
        labs(x="5 min Interval", y="Average count steps") +
        theme_bw()
